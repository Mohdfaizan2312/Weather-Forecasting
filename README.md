# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting System

A smart weather forecasting web application built using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Big Data** technologies. The system predicts future weather conditions like temperature, humidity, pressure, and rainfall using historical datasets and visualizes them interactively for users.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Web-based UI for user-friendly interaction
- 📈 Predicts temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, etc.
- 🤖 Machine Learning model trained on historical weather data
- 🗃️ Big Data integration for real-time or large-scale weather analytics
- 📊 Interactive graphs and charts using JavaScript (Chart.js or D3.js)
- 🌍 City-based forecasting with location input

🧠 Machine Learning Overview
Dataset: Weather data from Kaggle / NOAA / OpenWeatherMap

Model Used: Linear Regression / Random Forest / LSTM (based on time series)

Target Variable: Temperature, Rainfall, or Humidity

Preprocessing: Normalization, missing value handling, time-series split

Accuracy: ~85-90% depending on algorithm and region

🗃️ Big Data Integration (Optional)
If Big Data is implemented:

Hadoop HDFS for large weather datasets

Apache Spark for parallel data processing and model training

MongoDB or Cassandra for NoSQL data handling
